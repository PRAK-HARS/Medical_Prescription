## Overview

Gemini Image Demo integrates the capabilities of the Gemini API (`google.generativeai`) to facilitate:
- **Medical Prescription Analysis:** Users can input prompts related to medical prescriptions and medication details.
- **Image Context Interpretation:** Supports uploading images (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`) to provide visual context for the AI model.
- **Text Generation:** Generates textual responses based on the combination of input prompts and uploaded images.

This application is built with Streamlit, offering an intuitive web interface for seamless interaction and data visualization.

## Features

- **Streamlit App Interface:** User-friendly interface for easy interaction and real-time feedback.
- **Secure Environment Setup:** Utilizes `dotenv` for securely loading environment variables, including API keys.
- **Gemini API Integration:** Leverages the Gemini API for content generation based on AI models (`GenerativeModel`).

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

4. **Interact with the Application:**
   - Enter a text prompt related to medical prescriptions and medication details.
   - Upload an image (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`) to provide visual context.
   - Click on the "Tell me about the image" button to generate a textual response based on the input.

## Configuration

The application uses `dotenv` for managing environment variables. Ensure you have set up your `.env` file with the appropriate API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) before running the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for file uploads, API responses, and edge cases in medical prescription reading.
- **User Interface Improvements:** Provide more interactive features such as result visualization or user feedback mechanisms.
- **Model Customization:** Allow customization of AI models or integration with additional APIs for broader content generation capabilities.
